# Introduction to Algorithms
I am Jazl, an 8th grader, and I started programming when I was 9.

Recently, I started reading a book called Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H Cormen, Charles E Leiserson, Ronald L Rivest and Clifford Stein.

I would like to share some of the programs I wrote in Python based on the algorithms from this book.
